## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

### 🎨 Custom UI & Animations
The fintech space requires trust and "polish." I engineered several custom items and animations including:
* **Interactive Charts:** Tailored canvas-based graphs for financial tracking.
* **Motion Effects:** Coordinated layout transitions using `MotionLayout` to guide users through multi-step transactions.
* **Design System:** Built a reusable component library in XML and Jetpack Compose to ensure visual consistency across the ecosystem.

### ⚡ Speed & Optimization
Working with a million-user scale, every millisecond counts. My optimization focus included:
* **Loading Speed:** Optimized Retrofit/OkHttp interceptors and used **Dagger-Hilt** for efficient dependency graph management.
* **Memory Management:** Implemented strict profiling using **LeakCanary** and **Android Profiler** to eliminate jank during scrolling in modularized features.

---

## 🤝 Workflow & Collaboration
I thrive in high-performing, remote-first Agile teams. My workflow at Giftcard8 involved:

* **Project Management:** Utilizing **Zentao** for iterative sprint planning, bug tracking, and milestone management.
* **Design Collaboration:** Working closely with UI/UX designers in **Figma** to translate high-fidelity prototypes into pixel-perfect code.
* **Quality Assurance:** Participating in rigorous code reviews and collaborating with QA engineers to ensure stability across diverse Android hardware.
